# re-write ✍️

**Eurecha Sherij Anakimesta's Personal Developer Hub**

Welcome to `re-write` — my digital garden, writing desk, and professional portfolio, all in one. This site blends Markdown-powered content, a Golang backend for dynamic metrics, and a React + HeroUI frontend styled to feel as polished as Medium.

## 🧱 Stack

| Layer     | Tech                          |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Frontend  | Vite + React + HeroUI         |
| Styling   | Tailwind CSS v4               |
| Markdown  | `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`|
| Syntax    | `prismjs`                     |
| Backend   | Go + MongoDB (for metrics)    |

## 🧠 Features

- Blog posts written in Markdown with frontmatter parsing
- Code blocks styled like Medium with PrismJS
- Fully responsive layout using HeroUI components
- Tech stack filter with live search
- Contact buttons for quick connection
- Custom theme via HeroUI
- Optional extras like dark mode, cursor animation, and Konami code easter eggs

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

You’ll also need to run the Go backend separately if you’re tracking views/likes.

All blog posts live in the src/posts/ directory using .md files with frontmatter:
